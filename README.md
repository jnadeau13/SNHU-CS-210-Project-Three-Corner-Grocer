# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, the client (Corner Grocer) needed a program to analyze text records of items purchased throughout a given day, which are listed in chronological order from when the store opens to when it closes. This item-tracking system gives them how often items are purchased, thus allowing them to be able to rearrange their produce section in the most effective way to benefit the customer. Given a text-based input file of the items purchased for a single day, the program is able to output a list of all the items along with the number of times it was purchased that day, output the number a specific item was purchased that day, and output a text-based histogram, which lists all the items purchased that day and a representation of the number of times the item was purchased. 

# What did you do particularly well?
By integrating C++ and Python together, I was able to effectively use the strengths of Python's functions to analyze the data from the input file, and output that information using C++ to the user. 

# Where could you enhance you code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Although my code does handle run-time and user errors, I could utiltize try/block statements to more efficiently deal with errors. This could more effectively output the proper error messages as well as continue the program execution.

# Which pieces of code did you find the most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code to write was the function to determine the frequency of a specific item. To overcome this, I broke down the steps that needed to interate through the list to count the number of times an item appeared. There are many online coding resources with examples of how to execute certain concepts, which helped tremendously. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project was a great way to learn how to integrate two programming languages together. C++ and Python were both utilized to create a program to suit the client's needs. Being able to use more than one programming language in a project will be highly transferrable to other projects/course work as this is a beneficial skill to be able to produce effective and functional code.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I applied industry standard best practices. To start, I used in-line comments, appropriate naming conventions, and had minimal code in the main function. My code was also laid out in a logial manner which enhanced it's readablilty.
